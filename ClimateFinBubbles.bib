	Abstract = {Abstract This paper develops a stock-flow-fund ecological macroeconomic model that combines the stock-flow consistent approach of Godley and Lavoie with the flow-fund model of Georgescu-Roegen. The model has the following key features. First, monetary and physical stocks and flows are explicitly formalised taking into account the accounting principles and the laws of thermodynamics. Second, Georgescu-Roegen's distinction between stock-flow and fund-service resources is adopted. Third, output is demand-determined but supply constraints might arise either due to environmental damages or due to the exhaustion of natural resources. Fourth, climate change influences directly the components of aggregate demand. Fifth, finance affects macroeconomic activity and the materialisation of investment plans that determine ecological efficiency. The model is calibrated using global data. Simulations are conducted to investigate the trajectories of key environmental, macroeconomic and financial variables under (i) different assumptions about the sensitivity of economic activity to the leverage ratio of firms and (ii) different types of green finance policies. },

	Abstract = {The present work aims at contributing to the recent stream of literature which attempts to link the Neo-Schumpeterian/Evolutionary and the Post-Keynesian theory. The paper adopts the Post-Keynesian Stock Flow Consistent modeling approach to analyze the process of development triggered by the emergence of a new-innovative productive sector into the economic system. The model depicts a multi-sectorial economy composed of consumption and capital goods industries, a banking sector and two households sectors: capitalists and wage earners. Furthermore, it provides an explicit representation of the stock market. In line with the Schumpeterian tradition, our work highlights the cyclical nature of the development process and stresses the relevance of the finance-innovation nexus, analyzing the feed-back effects between the real and financial sides of the economic system. In this way we aim at setting the basis of a comprehensive and coherent framework to study the relationship between technological change, demand and finance along the structural change process triggered by technological innovation.},

@article{Dietz2016,
	Abstract = {Investors and financial regulators are increasingly aware of climate-change risks. So far, most of the attention has fallen on whether controls on carbon emissions will strand the assets of fossil-fuel companies. However, it is no less important to ask, what might be the impact of climate change itself on asset values? Here we show how a leading integrated assessment model can be used to estimate the impact of twenty-first-century climate change on the present market value of global financial assets. We find that the expected `climate value at risk' (climate VaR) of global financial assets today is 1.8\% along a business-as-usual emissions path. Taking a representative estimate of global financial assets, this amounts to US\$2.5 trillion. However, much of the risk is in the tail. For example, the 99th percentile climate VaR is 16.9\%, or US\$24.2 trillion. These estimates would constitute a substantial write-down in the fundamental value of financial assets. Cutting emissions to limit warming to no more than 2 $\,^{\circ}$C reduces the climate VaR by an expected 0.6 percentage points, and the 99th percentile reduction is 7.7 percentage points. Including mitigation costs, the present value of global financial assets is an expected 0.2\% higher when warming is limited to no more than 2 $\,^{\circ}$C, compared with business as usual. The 99th percentile is 9.1\% higher. Limiting warming to no more than 2 $\,^{\circ}$C makes financial sense to risk-neutral investors---and even more so to the risk averse.},

@techreport{KempBenedict2014,
	Abstract = {In the face of increasingly likely dangerous climate change, many developing countries are designing green economy or low-emissions development strategies, but are already on a course of investment in ``brown'' or high-emission infrastructure. Meanwhile, many high-income countries are working to reduce their emissions but are hampered by the cost of switching from an existing, high-emitting, capital stock. This paper looks at economic aspects of the challenge of escaping carbon lock-in using a ``brown-green capital'' model. In the model, brown capital is more productive than green capital in a brown-capital dominated economy, while the opposite is true for green capital. This introduces a network externality that dominates the environmental externality that the switch from brown to green capital is supposed to address. From Post Keynesian perspective, whether the transition will occur depends on the perception of investors in the face of fundamental uncertainty. If investors believe the government cannot sustain a push toward a green economy, then their belief can become self-fulfilling. Policies are likely to be more successful if potentially negative macroeconomic impacts can be managed; for a successful transition, governments must navigate within macroeconomic constraints while maintaining a credible effort from the point of view of financial markets. Using the model, we explore different macroeconomic outcomes and possible policy responses. Three results are particularly interesting. First, the effect of policy instruments depends upon whether the economy is wage-led or profit-led, a distinction that emerges from Post Keynesian theory. Second, if investors hedge against uncertainty over expected levels of green and brown investment, then there is likely to be underinvestment in green capital even at quite high levels of green-capital penetration, raising a substantial challenge for policymakers. Third, the model suggests an unusual role for a carbon price. Rather than correct an environmental externality, the carbon price controls inflationary pressure arising from public green capital investment while encouraging emissions reductions at the margin.},

	Abstract = {There has been an apparent resistance amongst mainstream investors to integrate the risk of stranded assets into investment decisions. This paper considers if the structure of the investment chain causes investors to be blind to risks such as stranded assets. This paper considers how the interaction between financial economic theory, regulation and the practices of the fund management industry gives rise to the way the industry analyses and manages risk. The paper draws on a mixture of academic literature and the author's own experience of industry practice. The paper finds that institutional investors are constrained to measure risk in relation to a benchmark; risk becomes a function of volatility and divergence from peers. The risk of stranded assets is invisible in the decision-making chain. The industry is further constrained by its culture, regulation and inappropriate incentives. The paper concludes that integrating stranded asset risk requires a drastic overhaul of the regulation of, and theory used in, the investment chain. This would better align the investment industry with the long-term capital allocation requirements of society.},

	Abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical discourse linking traditional market failure literature and the recent research around potential stranded assets risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy (defined here as `transition risks'). While it does not seek to prove a mispricing in practical terms, it demonstrates the extent to which the market failure literature provides theoretical evidence of a potential mispricing of these risks, as a result of the design and interpretation of financial risk models, and the practices and institutions linked to economic agents. The evidence supports a growing body of practical literature highlighting transition risks in financial markets. It suggests that there may be a case for policy intervention to address the market failures and associated potential mispricing of risk. It also suggests however that this intervention will likely need to address both the design of financial risk models and associated transparency around their results, and the actual institutions governing risk management. A key challenge in this regard involves resolving the principal--agent problem in financial markets and the associated `tragedy of the horizons'.},

@techreport{Battiston2016,
	Abstract = {We propose a novel methodological framework to assess the exposure of the financial system to climate policy risks. We extend the notion of climate policy risk scenarios in order to go beyond the mere fossil fuel production sector and encompass the indirect effects through key economic sectors such as energy-intensive sectors, housing and finance. Our methodology can be applied both bottom-up using micro-economic data and top-down using aggregate macro-economic sectoral data. As an illustration, we conduct and assessment of the exposures of European financial institutions through their portfolio of European and US equity holdings and loans. We find that the direct exposure to fossil fuel production sector and energy-intensive sectors, while limited overall, is important for investment funds. In turn, banks and pension funds have important exposures to investment funds, and thus bear important indirect exposure to fossil fuel. Further, the housing sector can potentially act as a trigger of a shock which then amplifies through the financial system.},

@article{McGlade2015,
	Abstract = {Policy makers have generally agreed that the average global temperature rise caused by greenhouse gas emissions should not exceed 2 $\,^{\circ}$C above the average global temperature of pre-industrial times. It has been estimated that to have at least a 50 per cent chance of keeping warming below 2 $\,^{\circ}$C throughout the twenty-first century, the cumulative carbon emissions between 2011 and 2050 need to be limited to around 1,100 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (Gt CO2). However, the greenhouse gas emissions contained in present estimates of global fossil fuel reserves are around three times higher than this, and so the unabated use of all current fossil fuel reserves is incompatible with a warming limit of 2 $\,^{\circ}$C. Here we use a single integrated assessment model that contains estimates of the quantities, locations and nature of the world/'s oil, gas and coal reserves and resources, and which is shown to be consistent with a wide variety of modelling approaches with different assumptions, to explore the implications of this emissions limit for fossil fuel production in different regions. Our results suggest that, globally, a third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80 per cent of current coal reserves should remain unused from 2010 to 2050 in order to meet the target of 2 $\,^{\circ}$C. We show that development of resources in the Arctic and any increase in unconventional oil production are incommensurate with efforts to limit average global warming to 2 $\,^{\circ}$C. Our results show that policy makers/' instincts to exploit rapidly and completely their territorial fossil fuels are, in aggregate, inconsistent with their commitments to this temperature limit. Implementation of this policy commitment would also render unnecessary continued substantial expenditure on fossil fuel exploration, because any new discoveries could not lead to increased aggregate production.},

@article{Daniel1998,
	Abstract = {We propose a theory of securities market under- and overreactions based on two well-known psychological biases: investor overconfidence about the precision of private information; and biased self-attribution, which causes asymmetric shifts in investors' confidence as a function of their investment outcomes. We show that overconfidence implies negative long-lag autocorrelations, excess volatility, and, when managerial actions are correlated with stock mispricing, public-event-based return predictability. Biased self-attribution adds positive short-lag autocorrelations (``momentum''), short-run earnings ``drift,'' but negative correlation between future returns and long-term past stock market and accounting performance. The theory also offers several untested implications and implications for corporate financial policy.},
